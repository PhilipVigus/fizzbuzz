# fizzbuzz

This is the project created from completing the first half of the pairing task in week 4 of the Makers pre-course.

It implements a fizzbuzz method, which returns "Fizz" if the argument given to the method is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if it's divisible by 5, "Fizzbuzz" if by both, and the number itself if neither.  

The full task asks you to complete the code twice, deleting your first attempt completely before you do it the second time. This project is the code before it was deleted. The second attempt can be found here:
- [fizzbuzz-part-2](https://github.com/PhilipVigus/fizzbuzz-part-2)

## Getting started

To use this project:
```bash
# clone a copy to your computer
git clone https://github.com/PhilipVigus/fizzbuzz

# install the project's only dependency
gem install rspec
```

## Usage

The only code in the project is a single method defined in fizzbuzz.rb, and an rspec test file, so there is nothing really to use.

## Running tests

```bash
# run from the project's root directory
rspec
```
